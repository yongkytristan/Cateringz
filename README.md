# Cateringz

This was an individual final project for the Human-Computer Interaction course. In this project, I was tasked with creating a catering website featuring the following pages: Home, Product, Testimonial, About Us, and Register.

I started by designing the mockups in Figma, then developed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was also designed to be fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. This was my first project using these web technologies. Through this experience, I gained a stronger understanding of front-end fundamentals and learned how to design a user-friendly UI that enhances the user experience.
